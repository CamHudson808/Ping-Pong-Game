# Ping-Pong-Game
Project me and Johnathan Kim made in our CS 145: Intro To Computing Course

Project which taught me how to create a game loop, use multiple classes to organize code as well as gamme logic like 
creating a specficed velocity and direction of the ball when it hits different parts of the paddle. As an extra
touch, added music and a background.
